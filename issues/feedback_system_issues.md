# Agentic Framework Feedback System Issues

This document tracks issues identified by the feedback system for the Agentic framework.

## Core Functionality Issues

### 1. Feedback System Integration
**Issue:** The feedback system is not fully integrated with the rest of the Agentic framework, making it difficult to track and address issues systematically.
**Status:** Open
**Priority:** High
**Reported:** 2025-03-13
**Description:** 
The current feedback system operates independently of the main framework components. This separation creates several problems:
- No centralized tracking of reported issues
- Lack of automated notification when issues are reported
- No standardized workflow for addressing and resolving feedback
- Difficulty in prioritizing issues based on impact and urgency

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Create a centralized feedback registry similar to the virtual environment registry
2. Implement a feedback submission API through the config.py system
3. Add feedback status tracking with standardized states (Open, In Progress, Resolved)
4. Develop integration with existing logging and monitoring systems
5. Create automated reporting to summarize feedback trends and highlight critical issues

**Impact:** Improving the feedback system integration will enhance the framework's ability to evolve based on real-world usage patterns and issues, leading to faster resolution of problems and more responsive improvements.
