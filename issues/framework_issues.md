# Agentic Framework Issues

This document outlines identified issues with the Agentic framework, particularly focusing on how rules and tools are loaded and managed.

## Initial Prompt and Discovery Issues

### 1. Path Confusion
The framework documentation doesn't clearly distinguish between the root Agentic folder ($HOME/Agentic) and the git-managed repository folder ($HOME/Agentic/agentic), leading to confusion when using git commands or referencing paths.

## Structural and Implementation Problems

### 6. Manual Rule Loading
The framework relies on AI agents correctly interpreting documentation with no programmatic mechanism to ensure complete and consistent rule loading.

### 7. No Verification System
There's no way to verify an AI agent has correctly loaded and understood all rules before proceeding with tasks, potentially leading to inconsistent application.

### 8. Limited Cross-Referencing
While documentation files reference each other, there's no structured system to ensure all relevant information is considered when performing tasks.

## Technical Implementation Issues

### 9. Dependency on External Tools
Heavy reliance on uv package manager creates a potential point of failure if the external tool changes its API or behavior.

### 10. Inconsistent Error Handling
Some scripts have robust error handling while others could be improved, particularly for edge cases, leading to potential reliability issues.

### 11. Lack of Automation for Initial Setup
While there's a `check_environment.py --fix` command, there's no single command to fully set up the environment from scratch, including installing uv, creating all necessary directories, etc.

### 12. Security Boundary Enforcement
Security relies primarily on documentation-based rules rather than technical enforcement mechanisms, potentially allowing AI agents to operate outside their designated areas.

## Usability and Integration Problems

### 13. Path Variability Handling
The framework doesn't adequately account for different installation paths or user home directories, potentially causing issues when scripts are run on different systems.

### 14. No Standardized API
Lacks a consistent API for AI agents to interact with the framework's functionality, leading to potential inconsistencies in how agents use the tools.

### 15. Limited Feedback Loop
No mechanism exists to confirm an AI agent is correctly following the rules during operation, potentially allowing rule violations to go undetected.

## Conclusion

These issues collectively create friction in the discovery, understanding, and application of the Agentic framework, particularly during first-time interactions. They highlight the need for both structural improvements to the framework itself and clearer communication protocols when instructing AI agents to use it.
